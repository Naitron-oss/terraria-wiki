    "info": "<b>Bait<\/b> is a group of items that is mandatory for fishing. When a fishing pole is cast, at least one bait item must be in the player's inventory; otherwise, nothing can be caught. Fishing poles will cast their lines with no baits, but there will be no \"bites\" and no catches. The bait item is only consumed once the player reels in the line with a catch on the hook. It is not consumed upon the player casting the line or the line being reeled in with no catch. Even when the player does reel in a fish, there is only a chance that the bait will be consumed.\n",
