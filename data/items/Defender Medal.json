    "info": "<b>Defender Medals<\/b> are a form of currency used by the Tavernkeep. When the Tavernkeep first spawns in, the player can obtain 5 Defender Medals by talking to the Tavernkeep and selecting the \"Eternia Crystal\" option, but this can only be done once. Defender Medals can also be obtained by completing waves in the Old One's Army event, dropped by the Eternia Crystal if it is still intact. Betsy will also drop a Treasure Bag in Expert Mode that rewards extra Defender Medals when opened.\n",
