    "info": "The <b>Graveyard<\/b> is a mini-biome that appears when three or more Tombstones are in close proximity. As the number of Tombstones increase, the game colors in the vicinity become gradually more desaturated, and lightning may randomly strike in the background. Graveyards cause Ghosts and Ravens to spawn, as well as night enemies like Zombies, Demon Eyes and Wandering Eyes in Hardmode, even during daytime hours.\n",
