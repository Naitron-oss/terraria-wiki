    "info": "A <b>Mana Booster<\/b> is one of the three power-ups occasionally dropped when striking an enemy while wearing a full set of Nebula armor. When picked up, it grants the <b>Mana Nebula<\/b> buff which immediately provides the player with an increased mana regeneration rate for 8 seconds. When a Mana Booster is picked up while the Mana Nebula buff is already in effect, it stacks with the previous Mana Nebula, for up to 3 stacked boosts. Every 8 seconds, one stacked Mana Booster expires, and the Mana Nebula buff decreases by one level.\n",
