    "info": "The <b>Cactus Pickaxe<\/b> is an early-game pickaxe that has the same power (35%) as the Copper and Tin Pickaxes, which is the lowest in the game. However, it has +1 range advantage over the Copper Pickaxe (the Copper Pickaxe has a range deduction, while the Cactus Pickaxe does not). Like other low-tier pickaxes, it can mine blocks and ores weaker than Meteorite (which can be mined with a Tungsten Pickaxe or better), and seems to have an almost identical mining time to that of its copper counterpart. This pickaxe differs from all other early-game pickaxes, though, as it is made entirely from Cactus, and is crafted at a Work Bench rather than an Anvil, meaning the player can craft it before even venturing underground. It can also function as a decent weapon early in the game as it deals 5 damage, 1 higher than the Copper Pickaxe. (As of 1.4 this is no longer the case)\n",
