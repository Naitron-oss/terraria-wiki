The items are to be equipped in social slots as they only provide a change in visual appearance. All three pieces can be dropped by the Pirate Corsair, Pirate Deckhand, Pirate Deadeye, and the Pirate Crossbower with a chance of 0.2% or 1\/500 for any piece. These enemies can all be found during a Pirate Invasion event.\n",
