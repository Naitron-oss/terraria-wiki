    "info": "A <b>Bee Hive<\/b> is a mini-biome located in the Underground Jungle. The hive itself is made from Hive blocks; on the interior, it contains pools of honey and typically one Larva. Destroying the Larva summons the Queen Bee. Any projectile, tool, weapon, or enemy will destroy the Larva with a single hit, so caution should be taken around the Larva if the player is not ready to fight the Queen Bee.\n",
