    "info": "<b>Hearts<\/b> (or <b>Candy Apples<\/b> during Halloween and <b>Candy Canes<\/b> during Christmas) are common power-ups which can be dropped by slain enemies (with a chance of 1\/12 (8.3%), as long as the player is below maximum health), broken Pots, or as a bonus drops from slimes. They are not inventory items, but are instead instantly consumed and restore 20 health. Enemies will only drop Hearts if the closest player is not at maximum health. They emit a faint red light.\n",
