Nearly anything can be painted, including blocks, background walls, and furniture, along with non-collectable environment objects like trees, tall grass, flowers, and other ambient growth. Basic Paint is purchased from the Painter NPC. Two of the same color can be combined at a Dye Vat to create \"Deep\" color versions, which apply their color more vividly and are required in order to paint certain objects.\n",
