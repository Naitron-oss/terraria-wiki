    "info": "<b>Hooks<\/b> are a class of tools which aid the player in traversing terrain. When used, hooks fire a chain that latches to a surface or platform and pulls the player towards it. A hook is an essential tool which offers significant freedom from terrain height restrictions as well as being a fast movement option, and will often be the first major mobility tool a player acquires. A variety of hooks are available at all stages of the game (see table below).\n",
